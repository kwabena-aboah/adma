	    		Introduction
	    	</blockquote>
			 
			<p class="flow-text">The Gbentanaa Zonal Council is one of the four Zonal Councils of the Adentan Municipality.  The main functions of the zonal Council include the mobilization of revenue, implementation of policies at the local level and also mobilize community to participate in decision making. As part of activities to help the Zonal Council properly plan and implement activities for development, the Zonal Council was assisted to come out with a four (4) years (2018-2021) Medium Term Development Plan which will guide the implementation of envisioned development projects and programmes in the zonal area.</p>

			<p class="flow-text">The preparation of this Medium Term Zonal Plan is to further deepen the decentralization process by bringing governance to the door-steps of the people through involving them in the Planning Process which affects their own life. In view of these, a series of meetings were held with the Zonal Council members and other stakeholders in order to come up with this document. The participants were expected to lead and assist in identifying the problems/ needs, goals and objectives of their Zonal Council and to harmonize these into a Zonal Council plan, hence the making of the this document.</p>

			<p class="flow-text">This document is a detailed plan enlisting the profile of the area in the first chapter, the problems and suggested solutions in the second chapter, the goals and strategies in the third chapter, the composite programmes of action in the fourth chapter and then the detailed projects and programmes for the various years in the last chapter.</p>

			<p class="flow-text">It is hoped that Stakeholders and development partners will support the efforts of the people of Gbentanaa Zonal Area to bring development to the Zonal area and thereby improve the living conditions of the people of the Zone.</p>
